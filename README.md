## About web-app

Someone once said, “If you fail to plan, you plan to fail”.

So after I’ve failed to manage my finances, I decided that something needs to be done about my spending habits. Thus, I decided to build an expense tracking web-app in order to help me better manage my personal finances, lest I spend all of my salary on food delivery and online shopping.
